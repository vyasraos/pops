## Security Features

POPS CLI implements several security measures:

### üîê Authentication Security
- Secure storage of Jira Personal Access Tokens
- Environment variable-based token management
- No hardcoded credentials in source code

### üõ°Ô∏è Input Validation
- Sanitization of user inputs
- Validation of configuration files
- Protection against path traversal attacks

### üîç Dependency Security
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Automated vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- License compliance checking

### üèóÔ∏è Build Security
- Signed releases with checksums
- Reproducible builds
- Supply chain security measures

## Known Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- `JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN` should be kept secure
- Never commit tokens to version control
- Use secure environment variable management

### Configuration Files
- Ensure `pops.toml` doesn't contain sensitive data
- Review file permissions on configuration files
- Use secure paths for template and data directories

### Network Security
- All Jira API calls use HTTPS
- Certificate validation is enforced
- No insecure HTTP fallbacks

## Security Best Practices for Users

### üîë Token Management
```bash
# Good: Use environment variables
export JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Good: Use .env files (add to .gitignore)
echo "JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN=your_token" > .env

# Bad: Don't hardcode in scripts
pops --token hardcoded_token_here  # DON'T DO THIS
```

### üìÅ File Permissions
```bash
# Secure your configuration
chmod 600 pops.toml
chmod 600 .env

# Secure your workspace
chmod 700 planning/
```

### üåê Network Security
```bash
# Always use HTTPS for Jira URLs
base_url = "https://your-company.atlassian.net"  # Good
base_url = "http://your-company.atlassian.net"   # Bad
```

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure policy:

1. **Private Report**: Vulnerability reported privately
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and develop a fix
3. **Validation**: Fix is tested and validated
4. **Release**: Security update is released
5. **Public Disclosure**: Advisory is published with details

### Public Advisory

After fixing a vulnerability, we will publish a security advisory including:

- CVE identifier (if applicable)
- Affected versions
- Impact assessment
- Mitigation steps
- Credit to the reporter (if desired)

## Security Updates

### Automatic Updates

Security updates are distributed through:

- **GitHub Releases**: New versions with security fixes
- **Package Managers**: Updated packages on npm, Homebrew
- **Notifications**: Security advisories via GitHub

### Manual Updates

Users should regularly update POPS CLI:

```bash
# Check current version
pops --version

# Update via Homebrew
brew upgrade pops-cli

# Update via npm
npm update -g pops-cli

# Update binary manually
curl -fsSL https://github.com/vyasraos/pops-cli/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
